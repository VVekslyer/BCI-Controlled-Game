# BCI-Controlled Pong Game

 - This is a game made with pygame which will use the OpenBCI headset as the controller.
 - The player will be able to control a basic pong game with their thoughts.
 	- If the player thinks about moving their paddle up, the paddle shall move up.
 	- If the player thinks about moving their paddle down, it shall move down.
 
 - This will be done using deep learning. This deep learning algorithm will recieve data from the player. 

 - The player will first of all play the game normally with a keyboard. The algorithm will detect which brainwaves are associated with wanting to move up and which are associated with wanting to move down. After some time of training the algorithm, the player should be able to move the paddle with their thoughts alone with no need for the keyboard.
